        <h1>Interactive map of Europe</h1>
          <p style="font-size: 30px">By Simon Kemmere, 10798250</p>

        <h2 class="title">Storytelling</h2>
        <p>This interactive map of Europe shows the average wage per colored country.
          The lighter green a country is, the higher the average wage in that country.
          A barchart will appear when clicking on a country, showing the percentage
          of 25-64 year-olds that finished a tertiary study. There is a lot of talk
          about the distribution in which women and men partake in doing tertiary studies.
          There used to be a lot more men partaking in studies at a university level.
          To show whether this is still the case the percentage of 25-64 year olds
          that finished a tertiary study is set out per gender.
          <br>
          Intuitively there is a connection between these variables, because the wage earned
          having finished a study at a university level is by average higher than the wage earned
          not having finished such a study at that level.
          Yet, is that really the case? Find out by exploring the map of Europe and
          selecting the countries, from which you'd like to see the abovementioned data.

           <p>
             "Average wages are obtained by dividing the national-accounts-based
             total wage bill by the average number of employees in the total economy,
             which is then multiplied by the ratio of the average usual weekly hours
             per full-time employee to the average usually weekly hours for all employees.
             This indicator is measured in USD constant prices using 2016 base year and
             Purchasing Power Parities (PPPs) for private consumption of the same year."

            The indicator is measured as a percentage of same age population;
            for tertiary education level, data are broken down by gender."

          <p>
            I've tried to make the website as accessible as possible.
            Meaning that I've tried to create a site that's easy on the eye,
            also making sure that it's layout and information is instantly clear.
            Personally I like sites that are simple, as they are clear in what they
            want to present, meaning that the user doesn't need to look everywhere
            before finding the information he or she wants.

          <h4 class="subtitle">Map of Europe</h4>
          <p>
            Via the distinction in green colors on the map of Europe,
            I've tried to allow some insight in the way the average wage
            in Europe per country is distributed. The green colors are
            relative to the height of the average wage. Each color should
            thus represent the of the average wage relatively to it's
            neighboring countries, thus creating a quick insight of
            how the average wage is distributed throughout Europe.

          <h4 class="subtitle">Bar Chart</h4>
          <p>
            I've chosen to present the data in a barchart. This was due to the
            fact that I wanted to show the way the tertiary education
            level was distributed per gender. In the beginning I considered
            using a piechart, but fractions that lie close to each other are hard
            to distinct in a piechart. That's why I've chosen to use a barchart.
            The bars are given the same color because they present the same variable.
